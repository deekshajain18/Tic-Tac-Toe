2. Run the script using a Python interpreter.
3. Choose the game mode (single-player or multiplayer).
4. Follow the on-screen instructions to make your moves.

## Game Rules

The standard Tic-Tac-Toe rules apply:

- Players take turns marking a square (1-9) on the 3x3 grid.
- The player who succeeds in placing three of their marks in a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal row wins.
- If the board is filled with no winner, the game is a draw.

## Installation
